Puppies are soft, cute, funny, and make a big mess. Every month or two our family fosters 6-12 week old puppies for a
puppy rescue nonprofit organization. We all enjoy cuddling their furry bodies after a clean bath. Fresh puppy smell is
great. The puppies play with each other and our adult dog. They look so funny when they lay on top of each other and
sleep. While puppies can be great fun, they also can make big messes. 4-6 puppies can make a lot of puppy pee and poop.
It's a challenge to keep the puppies and the puppy pen clean.
I don’t like cats and they don’t like me. I used to be allergic to them and I would get stuffed up and have hives. That
doesn’t seem to happen anymore. But I still don’t like them. I lived with 3 cats that were not good at peeing in the
litter box. They seemed to find something important to me and pee on it. Most of the time they peed on photographs or
papers that would be ruined. Cats also bring fleas into the house. There is nothing worse than having to flea dip cats
and also flea bomb a home. That is why I don’t like cats.
Nobody really understood Kevin. It wasn't that he was super strange or difficult. It was more that there wasn't enough
there that anyone wanted to take the time to understand him. This was a shame as Kevin had many of the answers to the
important questions most people who knew him had. It was even more of a shame that they'd refuse to listen even if Kevin
offered to give them the answers. So, Kevin remained silent, misunderstood, and kept those important answers to life to
himself.
The desert wind blew the tumbleweed in front of the car. Alex swerved to avoid the tumbleweed, but he turned the wheel a
bit too strong and the car left the road and skidded onto the dirt median. He instantly slammed on the brakes and the
car stopped in a cloud of dirt. When the dust cloud had settled and he could see around him again, he realized that he'd
somehow crossed over into an entirely new dimension.
At that moment, she realized that she had created her current life. It wasn't the life she wanted, but she took
responsibility for how it currently stood. Something clicked and she saw that every choice she made to this point in her
life had led to where her life stood at this very moment even if she knew this wasn't where she wanted to be. She
determined to choose to change it.
The headache wouldn't go away. She's taken medicine but even that didn't help. The monstrous throbbing in her head
continued. She had this happen to her only once before in her life and she realized that only one thing could be
happening.
She was in a hurry. Not the standard hurry when you're in a rush to get someplace, but a frantic hurry. The type of
hurry where a few seconds could mean life or death. She raced down the road ignoring speed limits and weaving between
cars. She was only a few minutes away when traffic came to a dead standstill on the road ahead.
There was little doubt that the bridge was unsafe. All one had to do was look at it to know that with certainty. Yet Bob
didn't see another option. He may have been able to work one out if he had a bit of time to think things through, but
time was something he didn't have. A choice needed to be made, and it needed to be made quickly.
The time to take action was now. All three men knew in their hearts this was the case, yet none of them moved a muscle
to try. They were all watching and waiting for one of the others to make the first move so they could follow a step or
two behind and help. The situation demanded a leader and all three men were followers.
Love isn't always a ray of sunshine. That's what the older girls kept telling her when she said she had found the
perfect man. She had thought this was simply bitter talk on their part since they had been unable to find true love like
hers. But now she had to face the fact that they may have been right. Love may not always be a ray of sunshine. That is
unless they were referring to how the sun can burn.
It was a good idea. At least, they all thought it was a good idea at the time. Hindsight would reveal that in reality,
it was an unbelievably terrible idea, but it would take another week for them to understand that. Right now, at this
very moment. they all agreed that it was the perfect course of action for the current situation.
She sat down with her notebook in her hand, her mind wandering to faraway places. She paused and considered all that had
happened. It hadn't gone as expected. When the day began she thought it was going to be a bad one, but as she sat
recalling the day's events to write them down, she had to admit, it had been a rather marvelous day.
What if dogs were racist? Would they care about fur color….. “son, only play with other tan dogs”? Or maybe it would
depend on breed, “honey, only play with other German Shepards, never poodles”. Better yet it could depend on occupation.
“I’m a sled dog while you’re only a running companion, leave me alone”. Maybe the neighborhood they live in could be the
way they choose which dogs to associate with and which to shun? Size could be the determining factor, “see how tall that
dog is, they are probably dumb”. Luckily dogs don’t discriminate. Just watch at a dog park. Big black and white dogs wag
