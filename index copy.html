                    <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">STEP 1 - COMPLETE THE FIRST LAYER CROSS

                        Keep WHITE centre on top
                        Put the GREEN centre piece in front (facing you)
                        Find the GREEN/ WHITE edge piece (it only has 2 colours) and turn it to one of the positions
                        shown below (keeping white
                        on top and green in front)
                        Choose the options below that matches your situation and follow the arrow steps to place the
                        GREEN/ WHITE edge piece in
                        place.
                        STEP1 - First Layer Cross

                        Keeping white on top, turn the cube so that a different colour face (center) is toward you.
                        Follow the above
                        instructions again. Repeat with the other two faces until the white cross is complete. This step
                        is quite intuitive; you
                        can do it for sure but it does take a little practice. Just move the white edges to their places
                        not messing up the ones
                        already fixed. 
                        STEP 2 - COMPLETE THE FIRST LAYER CORNERS

                        Keep WHITE on top
                        Put the GREEN centre piece in front (facing you)
                        Find the GREEN/WHITE/RED corner (it has 3 colours) and place it in one of the positions below
                        (without disturbing the
                        white cross)
                        Choose from the steps below to place the GREEN/WHITE/RED corner piece in place without
                        disturbing the white cross.
                        STEP2 - First Layer Corners
                        Possible Problem:
                        The corner you are looking for is in the top layer, but in the wrong position or turned the
                        wrong way around. Turn the
                        cube so that the corner is in the front right top corner then move the corner to the bottom
                        layer by following the
                        following steps.

                        Solution:

                        step1b - first layer corners
                        Perform these steps , then choose again from steps above to put the corner in place
                        Keeping white on top, turn the cube so that a different colour face is toward you. Follow the
                        above instructions again.
                        Repeat with the other two faces until the white layer is complete.

                        STEP 3 - COMPLETE SECOND LAYER
                        Keep WHITE on top
                        Find the GREEN/RED edge piece
                        If it is in the bottom layer, then turn the bottom layer to match the edge with the centre
                        colour (see fig below).
                        If the edge is not in the bottom layer, then go to Step C
                        Choose from the steps below to place the edge piece in place.
                        A/B

                        STEP3 - Second Layer Edges
                        C - Possible Problem:
                        The edge piece you want to move is in the second layer, but in the wrong position or the wrong
                        way around.

                        Solution: Turn the cube so that the edge is in the front layer then do either solution above to
                        move the piece into the
                        bottom row. The go back to step 3 above.



                        sep3b - Second Layer edges

                        Continue with steps A/B with different centers facing you until the second layer is complete

                        STEP 4 - COMPLETE THE THIRD LAYER CROSS
                        Turn the cube over (white is now on the bottom and yellow on top)
                        You should find that there is 0, 2 or 4 pieces (of the cross) facing upward. Ignore the corners
                        for now.
                        The idea is firstly to get the yellow cross and secondly to turn swap pieces to the correct
                        position in the cross.
                        Perform the algorithm below to get to the yellow cross. Make sure your cube is orientated is
                        shown in the image.


                        STEP4 - Last Layer Cross


                        Repeat this algorithm till you get the yellow cross

                        You will now have 4 or 2 edge pieces in the correct place. Matching with the center colors.
                        Ensure the correct edge
                        pieces are at the back and right face. Use the algorithm below to put the edge pieces in the
                        correct position.


                        STEP3b - Last layer Cross Permutate


                        Possible Problem:
                        Two pieces that are in the correct position are opposite each other.


                        Solution: Perform the steps above once and then turn the cube like the one shown above and
                        perform the steps again. 

                        STEP 5 - COMPLETE THE THIRD LAYER CORNERS

                        (1) First we will put the corners in the correct position (A).
                        You will now have either 0, 1 or ALL the corners pieces will be in their correct positions,
                        either the right way up or
                        reversed.
                        If one corner piece is in the correct corner turn the cube to that this correct corner is in the
                        front top right
                        position. The piece is in the correct position, BUT may not be turned the correct way around.

                        (A)STEP5a - Permutate Last Layer Corners

                        Repeat the sequence until all the corners are in the correct position.

                        Possible Problem: None of the corners is in the correct position.
                        Solution: Perform the steps in (A) once with ANY side facing you (YELLOW at the top). Now one
                        corner will be in the
                        correct position. Proceed with (A) above.

                        The next steps will turn the corners (one by one) the correct way and ultimately solve the cube.

                        NOTE: THIS ROUTINE MAY APPEAR TO UPSET THE REST OF THE CUBE. DO NOT DESPAIR AND KEEP THE SAME
                        SIDE FACING YOU IT WILL
                        ONLY BE SOLVED ONCE THE LAST CORNER IS ORIENTATED.</p>
